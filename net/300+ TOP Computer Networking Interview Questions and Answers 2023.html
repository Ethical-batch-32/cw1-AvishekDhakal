Network performance is measured in Bandwidth (throughput) and&nbsp;Latency (Delay). Bandwidth of a network is given by the number of bits&nbsp;that can be transmitted over the network in a certain period of time. Latency corresponds to how long it t5akes a message to travel from one&nbsp;end off a network to the other. It is strictly measured in terms of time.</p>
<p><strong>16. Define Routing?</strong><br>

<p><strong>18. When a switch is said to be congested?</strong><br>
It is possible that a switch receives packets faster than the shared link&nbsp;can accommodate and stores in its memory, for an extended period of&nbsp;time, then the switch will eventually run out of buffer space, and some&nbsp;packets will have to be dropped and in this state is said to congested&nbsp;state.</p>
<p><strong>19. What is semantic gap?</strong><br>
Defining a useful channel involves both understanding the applications&nbsp;requirements and recognizing the limitations of the underlying&nbsp;technology. The gap between what applications expects and what the&nbsp;underlying technology can provide is called semantic gap.</p>

b. Burst Error<br>
A Burst error means that two or more bits in the data have changed.</p>
<p><strong>43. What is Error Detection? What are its methods?</strong><br>
Data can be corrupted during transmission. For reliable communication&nbsp;errors must be deducted and Corrected. Error Detection uses the&nbsp;concept of redundancy, which means adding extra bits for detecting&nbsp;errors at the destination. The common Error Detection methods are<br>
a. Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC)<br>
b. Longitudinal Redundancy Check (VRC)<br>
c. Cyclic Redundancy Check (VRC)<br>
d. Checksum</p>
<p><strong>44. What is Redundancy?</strong><br>
The concept of including extra information in the transmission solely for&nbsp;the purpose of comparison. This technique is called redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>45. What is VRC?</strong><br>
It is the most common and least expensive mechanism for Error&nbsp;Detection. In VRC, a parity bit is added to every data unit so that the&nbsp;total number of 1s becomes even for even parity. It can detect all singlebit&nbsp;errors. It can detect burst errors only if the total number of errors in&nbsp;each data unit is odd.</p>
<p><strong>46. What is LRC?</strong><br>
In LRC, a block of bits is divided into rows and a redundant row of bits is&nbsp;added to the whole block. It can detect burst errors. If two bits in one&nbsp;data unit are damaged and bits in exactly the same positions in another<br>
data unit are also damaged, the LRC checker will not detect an error. In&nbsp;LRC a redundant data unit follows n data units.</p>
<p><strong>47. What is CRC?</strong><br>
CRC, is the most powerful of the redundancy checking techniques, is&nbsp;based on binary division.</p>
<p><strong>48. What is Checksum?</strong><br>
Checksum is used by the higher layer protocols (TCP/IP) for error&nbsp;detection</p>
<p><strong>49. List the steps involved in creating the checksum.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Divide the data into sections</li>
<li>Add the sections together using 1’s complement arithmetic</li>
<li>Take the complement of the final sum, this is the checksum.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>50. What are the Data link protocols?</strong><br>
Data link protocols are sets of specifications used to implement the data&nbsp;link layer. The categories of Data Link protocols are</p>
<p>1. Asynchronous&nbsp;Protocols<br>
2. Synchronous Protocols<br>
a. Character Oriented Protocols<br>
b. Bit Oriented protocols</p>
<p><strong>51. Compare Error Detection and Error Correction:</strong><br>
The correction of errors is more difficult than the detection. In error detection, checks only any error has occurred. In error correction, the exact number of bits that are corrupted and location in the message are known. The number of the errors and the size of the message are important factors.</p>
<p><strong>52. What is Forward Error Correction?</strong><br>
Forward error correction is the process in which the receiver tries to guess the message by using redundant bits.</p>
<p><strong>53. Define Retransmission?</strong><br>
Retransmission is a technique in which the receiver detects the occurrence of an error and asks the sender to resend the message.<br>
Resending is repeated until a message arrives that the receiver believes is error-freed.</p>
<p><strong>54. What are Data Words?</strong><br>
In block coding, we divide our message into blocks, each of k bits, called datawords. The block coding process is one-to-one. The same dataword is always encoded as the same codeword.</p>
<p><strong>55. What are Code Words?</strong><br>
“r” redundant bits are added to each block to make the length n = k + r. The resulting n-bit blocks are called codewords. 2n – 2k codewords that are not used. These codewords are invalid or illegal.</p>
<p><strong>56. What is a Linear Block Code?</strong><br>
A linear block code is a code in which the exclusive OR (addition modulo-2) of two valid codewords creates another valid codeword.</p>
<p><strong>57. What are Cyclic Codes?</strong><br>
Cyclic codes are special linear block codes with one extra property. In a cyclic code, if a codeword is cyclically shifted (rotated), the result is another codeword.</p>
<p><strong>58. Define Encoder?</strong><br>
A device or program that uses predefined algorithms to encode, or compress audio or video data for storage or transmission use. A circuit that is used to convert between digital video and analog video.</p>
<p><strong>59. Define Decoder?</strong><br>
A device or program that translates encoded data into its original format (e.g. it decodes the data). The term is often used in reference to MPEG-2 video and sound data, which must be decoded before it is output.</p>
<p><strong>60. What is Framing?</strong><br>
Framing in the data link layer separates a message from one source to a destination, or from other messages to other destinations, by adding a sender address and a destination address. The destination address defines where the packet has to go and the sender address helps the recipient acknowledge the receipt.</p>
<h3><em>NETWORKING Interview Questions ::</em></h3>
<p><strong>61. What is Fixed Size Framing?</strong><br>
In fixed-size framing, there is no need for defining the boundaries of the frames. The size itself can be used as a delimiter.</p>
<p><strong>62. Define Character Stuffing?</strong><br>
In byte stuffing (or character stuffing), a special byte is added to the data section of the frame when there is a character with the same pattern as the flag. The data section is stuffed with an extra byte. This byte is usually called the escape character (ESC), which has a predefined bit pattern. Whenever the receiver encounters the ESC character, it removes it from the data section and treats the next character as data, not a delimiting flag.</p>
<p><strong>63. What is Bit Stuffing?</strong><br>
Bit stuffing is the process of adding one extra 0 whenever five consecutive Is follow a 0 in the data, so that the receiver does not mistake the pattern 0111110 for a flag.</p>
<p><strong>64. What is Flow Control?</strong><br>
Flow control refers to a set of procedures used to restrict the amount of data that the sender can send before waiting for acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>65. What is Error Control ?</strong><br>
Error control is both error detection and error correction. It allows the receiver to inform the sender of any frames lost or damaged in transmission and coordinates the retransmission of those frames by the sender. In the data link layer, the term error control refers primarily to methods of error detection and retransmission.</p>
<p><strong>66. What Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)?</strong><br>
Error control is both error detection and error correction. It allows the receiver to inform the sender of any frames lost or damaged in transmission and coordinates the retransmission of those frames by the sender. In the data link layer, the term error control refers primarily to methods of error detection and retransmission. Error control in the data link layer is often implemented simply: Any time an error is detected in an exchange, specified frames are retransmitted. This process is called automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p>
<p><strong>67. What is Stop-and-Wait Protocol?</strong><br>
In Stop and wait protocol, sender sends one frame, waits until it receives confirmation from the receiver (okay to go ahead), and then sends the next frame.</p>
<p><strong>68. What is Stop-and-Wait Automatic Repeat Request?</strong><br>
Error correction in Stop-and-Wait ARQ is done by keeping a copy of the sent frame and retransmitting of the frame when the timer expires.</p>
<p><strong>69. What is usage of Sequence Number in Relaible Transmission?</strong><br>
The protocol specifies that frames need to be numbered. This is done by using sequence numbers. A field is added to the data frame to hold the sequence number of that frame. Since we want to minimize the frame size, the smallest range that provides unambiguous communication. The sequence numbers can wrap around.</p>
<p><strong>70. What is Pipelining ?</strong><br>
In networking and in other areas, a task is often begun before the previous task has ended. This is known as pipelining.</p>
<p><strong>71. What is Sliding Window?</strong><br>
The sliding window is an abstract concept that defines the range of sequence numbers that is the concern of the sender and receiver. In other words, he sender and receiver need to deal with only part of the possible sequence numbers.</p>
<p><strong>72. What is Piggy Backing?</strong><br>
A technique called piggybacking is used to improve the efficiency of the bidirectional protocols. When a frame is carrying data from A to B, it can also carry control information about arrived (or lost) frames from B; when a frame is carrying data from B to A, it can also carry control information about the arrived (or lost) frames from A.</p>
<p><strong>73. What are the two types of transmission technology available?&nbsp;</strong><br>
(i) Broadcast and (ii) point-to-point</p>
<p><strong>74. What is subnet?</strong><br>
A generic term for section of a large networks usually separated by a bridge or router.</p>
<p><strong>75. Difference between the communication and transmission.</strong><br>

<p><strong>78. What do you meant by “triple X” in Networks?</strong><br>
The function of PAD (Packet Assembler Disassembler) is described in a document known as X.3. The standard protocol has been defined between the terminal and the PAD, called X.28; another standard protocol exists between hte PAD and the network, called X.29. Together, these three recommendations are often called “triple X”.</p>
<p><strong>79. What is frame relay, in which layer it comes?</strong><br>
Frame relay is a packet switching technology. It will operate in the data link layer.</p>
<p><strong>80. What is terminal emulation, in which layer it comes?</strong><br>
Telnet is also called as terminal emulation. It belongs to application layer.</p>
<p><strong>81. What is Beaconing?</strong><br>
The process that allows a network to self-repair networks problems. The stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions. Beaconing is used in Token ring and FDDI networks.</p>
<p><strong>82. What is redirector?</strong><br>
Redirector is software that intercepts file or prints I/O requests and translates them into network requests. This comes under presentation layer.</p>
<p><strong>83. What is NETBIOS and NETBEUI?</strong><br>
NETBIOS is a programming interface that allows I/O requests to be sent to and received from a remote computer and it hides the networking hardware from applications.<br>
NETBEUI is NetBIOS extended user interface. A transport protocol designed by microsoft and IBM for the use on small subnets.</p>
<p><strong>84. What is RAID?</strong><br>
A method for providing fault tolerance by using multiple hard disk drives.</p>
<p><strong>85. What is passive topology?</strong><br>

<p><strong>90. What is attenuation?</strong><br>
The degeneration of a signal over distance on a network cable is called attenuation.</p>
<p><strong>91. What is MAC address?</strong><br>
The address for a device as it is identified at the Media Access Control (MAC) layer in the network architecture. MAC address is usually stored in ROM on the network adapter card and is unique.</p>
<p><strong>92. Difference between bit rate and baud rate.&nbsp;</strong><br>
Bit rate is the number of bits transmitted during one second whereas baud rate refers to the number of signal units per second that are required to represent those bits.<br>
baud rate = (bit rate / N) where N is no-of-bits represented by each signal shift.</p>
<p><strong>93. What is Bandwidth?</strong><br>
Every line has an upper limit and a lower limit on the frequency of signals it can carry. This limited range is called the bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>94. What are the types of Transmission media?</strong><br>
Signals are usually transmitted over some transmission media that are<br>
broadly classified in to two categories.<br>
a.) Guided Media: These are those that provide a conduit from one<br>
device to another that include twisted-pair, coaxial cable and fiber-optic<br>
cable. A signal traveling along any of these media is directed and is<br>
contained by the physical limits of the medium. Twisted-pair and coaxial<br>
cable use metallic that accept and transport signals in the form of<br>
electrical current. Optical fiber is a glass or plastic cable that accepts<br>
and transports signals in the form of light.<br>
b.) Unguided Media: This is the wireless media that transport<br>
electromagnetic waves without using a physical conductor. Signals are<br>
broadcast either through air. This is done through radio communication,<br>
satellite communication and cellular telephony.</p>
<p><strong>95. What is Project 802?</strong><br>
It is a project started by IEEE to set standards to enable<br>
intercommunication between equipment from a variety of manufacturers.<br>
It is a way for specifying functions of the physical layer, the data link<br>
layer and to some extent the network layer to allow for interconnectivity<br>
of major LAN protocols.<br>
It consists of the following:<br>
1. 802.1 is an internetworking standard for compatibility of different LANs<br>
and MANs across protocols.<br>
2. 802.2 Logical link control (LLC) is the upper sublayer of the data link<br>
layer which is non-architecture-specific, that is remains the same for all<br>
IEEE-defined LANs.<br>
3. Media access control (MAC) is the lower sublayer of the data link layer<br>
that contains some distinct modules each carrying proprietary<br>
information specific to the LAN product being used. The modules are<br>
Ethernet LAN (802.3), Token ring LAN (802.4), Token bus LAN (802.5).<br>
4. 802.6 is distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) designed to be used in<br>
MANs.</p>
<p><strong>96. What is Protocol Data Unit?</strong><br>
The data unit in the LLC level is called the protocol data unit (PDU). The<br>
PDU contains of four fields a destination service access point (DSAP), a<br>
source service access point (SSAP), a control field and an information<br>
field. DSAP, SSAP are addresses used by the LLC to identify the<br>
protocol stacks on the receiving and sending machines that are<br>
generating and using the data. The control field specifies whether the<br>
PDU frame is a information frame (I – frame) or a supervisory frame (S –<br>
frame) or a unnumbered frame (U – frame).</p>
<p><strong>97. What are the different type of networking / internetworking devices?</strong><br>
1. Repeater: Also called a regenerator, it is an electronic device that<br>
operates only at physical layer. It receives the signal in the network<br>
before it becomes weak, regenerates the original bit pattern and puts the<br>
refreshed copy back in to the link.<br>
2. Bridges: These operate both in the physical and data link layers of<br>
LANs of same type. They divide a larger network in to smaller segments.<br>
They contain logic that allow them to keep the traffic for each segment<br>
separate and thus are repeaters that relay a frame only the side of the<br>
segment containing the intended recipent and control congestion.<br>
3. Routers: They relay packets among multiple interconnected networks<br>
(i.e. LANs of different type). They operate in the physical, data link and<br>
network layers. They contain software that enable them to determine<br>
which of the several possible paths is the best for a particular<br>
transmission.<br>
4. Gateways: They relay packets among networks that have different<br>
protocols (e.g. between a LAN and a WAN). They accept a packet<br>
formatted for one protocol and convert it to a packet formatted for<br>
another protocol before forwarding it. They operate in all seven layers of<br>
the OSI model.</p>
<p><strong>98. What is ICMP?</strong><br>
ICMP is Internet Control Message Protocol, a network layer protocol of the TCP/IP suite used by hosts and gateways to send notification of datagram problems back to the sender. It uses the echo test / reply to test whether a destination is reachable and responding. It also handles both control and error messages.</p>
<p><strong>99. What are the data units at different layers of the TCP / IP protocol suite?</strong><br>
The data unit created at the application layer is called a message, at the transport layer the data unit created is called either a segment or an user datagram, at the network layer the data unit created is called the datagram, at the data link layer the datagram is encapsulated in to a frame and finally transmitted as signals along the transmission media.</p>
<p><strong>100. What is difference between ARP and RARP?</strong><br>
The address resolution protocol (ARP) is used to associate the 32 bit IP address with the 48 bit physical address, used by a host or a router to find the physical address of another host on its network by sending a ARP query packet that includes the IP address of the receiver. The reverse address resolution protocol (RARP) allows a host to discover its Internet address when it knows only its physical address.</p>
<p><strong>101. What is the minimum and maximum length of the header in the TCP segment and IP datagram?</strong><br>
The header should have a minimum length of 20 bytes and can have a maximum length of 60 bytes.</p>
<p><strong>102. What is the range of addresses in the classes of internet addresses?</strong><br>
Class A – 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255<br>
Class B – 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255<br>
Class C – 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255<br>
Class D – 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255<br>
Class E – 240.0.0.0 – 247.255.255.255</p>
<p><strong>103. What is the difference between TFTP and FTP application layer protocols?</strong><br>
The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) allows a local host to obtain files from a remote host but does not provide reliability or security. It uses the fundamental packet delivery services offered by UDP. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard mechanism provided by TCP / IP for copying a file from one host to another. It uses the services offer by TCP and so is reliable and secure. It establishes two connections (virtual circuits) between the hosts, one for data transfer and another for control information.</p>
<p><strong>104. What are major types of networks and explain?</strong><br>
1. Server-based network: provide centralized control of network resources and rely on server computers to provide security and network administration<br>
2. Peer-to-peer network: computers can act as both servers sharing resources and as clients using the resources.</p>
<p><strong>105. What are the important topologies for networks?</strong><br>
1. BUS topology: In this each computer is directly connected to primary network cable in a single line. Advantages: Inexpensive, easy to install, simple to understand, easy to extend.<br>
2. STAR topology: In this all computers are connected using a central hub.<br>
Advantages: Can be inexpensive, easy to install and reconfigure and easy to trouble shoot physical problems.<br>
3. RING topology: In this all computers are connected in loop.<br>
Advantages: All computers have equal access to network media, installation can be simple, and signal does not degrade as much as in other topologies because each computer regenerates it.</p>

<p><strong>108. Explain 5-4-3 rule?</strong><br>
In a Ethernet network, between any two points on the network ,there can be no more than five network segments or four repeaters, and of those five segments only three of segments can be populated.</p>
<p><strong>109. What MAU?</strong><br>
In token Ring , hub is called Multistation Access Unit(MAU).</p>
<p><strong>110. What is the difference between routable and non- routable protocols?</strong><br>

<p><strong>113. What is virtual channel?</strong><br>
Virtual channel is normally a connection from one source to one destination, although multicast connections are also permitted. The other name for virtual channel is virtual circuit.</p>
<p><strong>114. What is virtual path?</strong><br>
Along any transmission path from a given source to a given destination, a group of virtual circuits can be grouped together into what is called path.</p>
<p><strong>115. What is packet filter?</strong><br>
Packet filter is a standard router equipped with some extra functionality. The extra functionality allows every incoming or outgoing packet to be inspected. Packets meeting some criterion are forwarded normally. Those that fail the test are dropped.</p>
<p><strong>116. What is traffic shaping?</strong><br>
One of the main causes of congestion is that traffic is often busy. If hosts could be made to transmit at a uniform rate, congestion would be less common. Another open loop method to help manage congestion is forcing the packet to be transmitted at a more predictable rate. This is called traffic shaping.</p>
<p><strong>117. What is multicast routing?</strong><br>
Sending a message to a group is called multicasting, and its routing algorithm is called multicast routing.</p>
<p><strong>118. What is region?</strong><br>
When hierarchical routing is used, the routers are divided into what we will call regions, with each router knowing all the details about how to route packets to destinations within its own region, but knowing nothing about the internal structure of other regions.</p>
<p><strong>119. What is silly window syndrome?</strong><br>
It is a problem that can ruin TCP performance. This problem occurs<br>
when data are passed to the sending TCP entity in large blocks, but an<br>
interactive application on the receiving side reads 1 byte at a time.</p>
<p><strong>120. What are Digrams and Trigrams?</strong><br>
The most common two letter combinations are called as digrams. e.g. th,<br>
in, er, re and an. The most common three letter combinations are called<br>
as trigrams. e.g. the, ing, and, and ion.</p>
<p><strong>121. Expand IDEA.</strong><br>
IDEA stands for International Data Encryption Algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>122. What is wide-mouth frog?</strong><br>

identify the set of networks that can be reached within or via each<br>
autonomous system.</p>
<p><strong>126. What is autonomous system?</strong><br>
It is a collection of routers under the control of a single administrative authority and that uses a common Interior Gateway Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>127. What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?</strong><br>
It is a protocol used to advertise the set of networks that can be reached with in an autonomous system. BGP enables this information to be shared with the autonomous system. This is newer than EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol).</p>
<p><strong>128. What is Gateway-to-Gateway protocol?</strong><br>
It is a protocol formerly used to exchange routing information between Internet core routers.</p>
<p><strong>129. What is NVT (Network Virtual Terminal)?</strong><br>

It is a host that has a multiple network interfaces and that requires multiple IP addresses is called as a Multi-homed Host.</p>
<p><strong>131. What is Kerberos?</strong><br>
It is an authentication service developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos uses encryption to prevent intruders from discovering passwords and gaining unauthorized access to files.</p>
<p><strong>132. What is OSPF?</strong><br>
It is an Internet routing protocol that scales well, can route traffic along multiple paths, and uses knowledge of an Internet’s topology to make accurate routing decisions.</p>
<p><strong>133. What is Proxy ARP?</strong><br>
It is using a router to answer ARP requests. This will be done when the<br>
originating host believes that a destination is local, when in fact is lies<br>
beyond router.</p>
<p><strong>134. What is SLIP (Serial Line Interface Protocol)?</strong><br>
